# STAT184_Summer_Project_Galant

My goal with this project is to look at how crime in Montgomery County has changed over time.
I want to see how crime amount has changed specifically in Montgomery County over the last 10
years, and then take a wider look and see how it has changed over a longer span of time. My second
objective is to see how the Montgomery County crime amounts compare to other large surrounding
counties.

The final report is in Stat_184_Project.pdf while the final qmd is in Stat_184_Project.qmd. The code for
the project is Violent_Crime___Property_Crime_by_County__1975_to_Present_20250812.csv and the primary
dataset is in a large file system saved in the .gitattrributes because of the size. When running the project
on your own computer replace the read.csv with the correct files after download as I just loaded them directly
from locations on my computer. 

The final datasets after wrangling are saved as:
  1. montgomery_crime_by_year_district.csv - County crime split by month, year, and district
  2. montgomery_year_by_crime.csv - County data split by crime and year
  3. md_crime_high_volume.csv - Multiple county data split into higher volume crimes
  4. md_crime_low_volume_violent.csv - Multiple county data split into low volume more violent crime

These are the final datasets created for making visualizations that concern only the information pertinent to my
report. 

My bibliography file is used to create the bibliography in the report and finally my project checklist is saved as
a rendered pdf file as well.
